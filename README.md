Terraform `secret` Provider &#x1F49C;
===================================

The `secret` provider has one mission: store secrets in the Terraform state.

Please be careful about your security stance before adopting this!

The main goal of this provider is that a lot of time, terraform contains
secrets in it's state file anyways. Instead of putting them in the repo and
the loading them with `"${file("./secret")}"` why not import them directly
into the state file?

When using a remote state file, the state is automatically distributed with
the new secret which makes key rotation easier.

This is only a better solution than storing secrets in Git. Look at adopting
Hashicorp Vault in the longer term.

## Requirements

-	[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.10.x
-	[Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.8 (to build the provider plugin)

## How to install

### Using pre-built binary

1. Download the binary from the project [releases page](https://github.com/bilderlings/terraform-provider-secret/releases/latest)
2. Copy to `$PATH` or the `~/.terraform.d/plugins` directory so Terraform can find it.

### Building from source

1. Follow these [instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install) to setup a Golang development environment.
2. Use `go get` to pull down this repository and compile the binary:

```
go get -u -v github.com/tweag/terraform-provider-secret
```

### Using Nix

If you are lucky enough to use [Nix](https://builtwithnix.org), it's
already part of the full terraform distribution:

```sh
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.terraform-full
```

## Building The Provider

Clone repository to: `$GOPATH/src/github.com/tweag/terraform-provider-secret`

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:tweag/terraform-provider-secret $GOPATH/src/github.com/tweag/terraform-provider-secret
```

Enter the provider directory and build the provider

```sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/tweag/terraform-provider-secret
$ make build
```

Using the provider
----------------------

### `secret_resource`

**Schema**:

* `value`, string: Returns the value of the secret

### Example

Here we declare a new resource that will contain the secret.

```tf
resource "secret_resource" "datadog_api_key" {
  lifecycle {
    # avoid accidentally loosing the secret
    prevent_destroy = true
  }
}
```

To populate the secret, run
```
terraform import secret_resourc.datadog_api_key TOKEN
```
where `TOKEN` is the value of the token.

Once imported, the secret can be accessed using
`secret_resourc.datadog_api_key.value`

### Rotating secrets

```sh
terraform state rm secret_resource.datadog_api_key
terraform import secret_resourc.datadog_api_key NEW_TOKEN
```

## Developing the Provider

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (version 1.8+ is *required*). You'll also need to correctly setup a [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), as well as adding `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`.

To compile the provider, run `make build`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

```sh
$ make bin
...
$ $GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-secret
...
```

In order to test the provider, you can simply run `make test`.

```sh
$ make test
```

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run `make testacc`.

*Note:* Acceptance tests create real resources, and often cost money to run.

```sh
$ make testacc
```
